# Stash

 Stash by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for [restic](https://restic.net). If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you might want to take backup of your disks, databases etc. Traditional tools are too complex to setup and maintain in a dynamic compute environment like Kubernetes. `restic` is a backup program that is fast, efficient and secure with few moving parts. Stash is a CRD controller for Kubernetes built around `restic` to address these issues. Using Stash, you can backup Kubernetes volumes mounted in workloads, stand-alone volumes and databases.
