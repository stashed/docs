# BackupConfigurationTemplate

## What is BackupConfigurationTemplate

Stash uses 1-1 mapping among `Repository`, `BackupConfiguration` and the target. So, whenever you want to backup a target(workload/PV/PVC/database), you have to create a `Repository` and `BackupConfiguration` object. This could become tiresome when you are trying to backup similar types of target and the `Repository` and `BackupConfiguration` has only slight difference. To mitigate this problem, Stash provides a way to specify a template for these two objects via `BackupConfigurationTemplate` crd.

A `BackupConfigurationTemplate` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition`(CRD) which specifies a template for `Repository` and `BackupConfiguration` in a Kubernetes native way.

You have to create only one  `BackupConfigurationTemplate` for all similar types of workload (i.e. Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet, Database etc.). Then, you just need to add some annotations in the target workload. Stash will automatically create respective `Repository`, `BackupConfiguration` object using the template. In Stash parlance, we call this process as **default backup**.

## BackupConfigurationTemplate CRD Specification

Like any official Kubernetes resource, a `BackupConfigurationTemplate` has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta` and `Spec` sections. However, unlike other Kubernetes resources, it does not have a `Status` section.

A sample `BackupConfigurationTemplate` object to backup a Deployment's data through default backup is shown below,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfigurationTemplate
metadata:
  name: workload-backup-template
spec:
  # ============== Template for Repository ==========================
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-backup
      prefix: stash/${TARGET_NAMESPACE}/${TARGET_KIND}/${TARGET_NAME}
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
  wipeOut: false
  # ============== Template for BackupConfiguration =================
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  # task: # no task section is required for workload data backup
  #   name: workload-backup
  runtimeSettings:
    container:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 2000
        runAsGroup: 2000
  tempDir:
    medium: "Memory"
    size:  "1Gi"
    disableCache: false
  retentionPolicy:
    name: 'keep-last-5'
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

The sample `BackupConfigurationTemplate` that has been shown above can be used to backup Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, ReplicaSets and ReplicationControllers. You only have to add some annotations to these workloads. For more details about what annotations you have to add to the targets, please visit [here](/docs/guides/default-backup/overview.md).

Here, we are going to describe the various sections of `BackupConfigurationTemplate` crd.

### BackupConfigurationTemplate `Spec`

We can divide BackupConfigurationTemplate's `.spec` section into two parts. One part specifies template for `Repository` object and other specifies template for `BackupConfiguration` object.

#### Repository Template

You can configure `Repository` template using `spec.backend` field and `spec.wipeOut` field.

- **spec.backend :** `spec.backend` field is backend specification similar to [spec.backend](/docs/concepts/crds/repository.md#specbackend) field of a `Repository` crd. There is only one difference. You can now templatize `prefix` section (`subPath` for local volume) of the backend to store backed up data of different workloads at different directory. You can use the following variables to templatize `spec.backend` field:

    |       Variable       |                                  Usage                                  |
    | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `TARGET_API_VERSION` | API version of the target                                               |
    | `TARGET_KIND`        | Resource kind of the target                                             |
    | `TARGET_NAMESPACE`   | Namespace of the target                                                 |
    | `TARGET_NAME`        | Name of the target                                                      |
    | `TARGET_RESOURCE`    | Plural form of the target kind. i.e. `deployments`, `statefulsets` etc. |

    If we use the sample `BackupConfigurationTemplate` that has been shown above to backup a Deployment named `my-deploy` of `test` namespace, the backed up file will be stored in `stash/test/deployment/my-deploy` directory of the `stash-backup` bucket. If we want to backup a ReplicaSet with name `my-rs` of same namespace, the backed up data will be stored in `/stash/test/replicaset/my-rs` directory of the backend.

- **spec.wipeOut :** `spec.wipeOut` indicates whether Stash should delete backed up data from the backend if a user deletes respective `Repository` crd for a target. For more details, please visit [here](/docs/concepts/crds/repository.md#specwipeout).

#### BackupConfiguration Template

You can set a template for the `BackupConfiguration` object that will be created for respective target using the following fields:

- **spec.schedule :** `spec.schedule` is the schedule that will be used to create `BackupConfiguration` for respective target. For more details, please visit [here](/docs/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration.md#specschedule).

- **spec.task :** `spec.task` specifies the name and the parameters of [Task](/docs/concepts/crds/task.md) template to use to backup the target.

- **spec.runtimeSettings :** `spec.runtimeSettings` allows to configure runtime environment for the backup sidecar or job. For more details, please visit [here](/docs/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration.md#specruntimesettings).

- **spec.tempDir :** `spec.tempDir` specifies the temporary volume setting that will be used to create respective `BackupConfiguration` object. For more details, please visit [here](/docs/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration.md#spectempdir).

- **spec.retentionPolicy :** `spec.retentionPolicy` specifies the retention policies that will be used to create respective `BackupConfiguration` object. For more details, please visit [here](/docs/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration.md#specretentionpolicy).
