# BackupConfiguration

## What is BackupConfiguration

A `BackupConfiguration` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition`(CRD) which specifies the backup target, parameters(schedule, retention policy etc.) and a `Repository` object that holds snapshot storage information in a Kubernetes native way.

You have to create a `BackupConfiguration` object for each backup target. A backup target can be a workload, database or a PV/PVC.

## BackupConfiguration CRD Specification

Like any official Kubernetes resource, a `BackupConfiguration` has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta` and `Spec` sections. However, unlike other Kubernetes resources, it does not have a `Status` section.

A sample `BackupConfiguration` object to backup the volumes of a Deployment is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: demo-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  driver: Restic
  repository:
    name: local-repo
  # task:
  #   name: workload-backup # task field is not required for workload data backup but it is necessary for database backup.
  schedule: "* * * * *" # backup at every minutes
  paused: false
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: stash-demo
    paths:
    - /source/data
    volumeMounts:
    - name: source-data
      mountPath: /source/data
  runtimeSettings:
    container:
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 256M
        limits:
          memory: 256M
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 2000
        runAsGroup: 2000
      nice:
        adjustment: 5
      ionice:
        class: 2
        classData: 4
    pod:
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name:  my-private-registry-secret
      serviceAccountName: my-backup-svc
  tempDir:
    medium: "Memory"
    size:  "2Gi"
    disableCache: false
  retentionPolicy:
    name: 'keep-last-5'
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

Here, we are going to describe the various sections of `BackupConfiguration` crd.

### BackupConfiguration `Spec`

A `BackupConfiguration` object has the following fields in the `spec` section.

#### spec.driver

`spec.driver` indicates the mechanism used to backup a target. Currently, Stash supports `Restic` and `VolumeSnapshotter` as drivers. The default value of this field is `Restic`.

|       Driver        |                                                                                                          Usage                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Restic`            | Used to backup workload data, persistent volumes data and databases. It uses [restic](https://restic.net) to backup the target.                                                                                          |
| `VolumeSnapshotter` | Used to take snapshot of PersistentVolumeClaims of a targeted workload. It leverages Kubernetes [VolumeSnapshot](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) crd and CSI driver to snapshot the PVCs. |

#### spec.target

`spec.target` field indicates the target for backup runs. This field consists of the following sub-fields:

- **spec.target.ref :** `spec.target.ref` refers to the target of backup. You have to specify `apiVersion`, `kind` and `name` of the target. Stash will use this information to inject a sidecar to the target or to create a backup job for it.

- **spec.target.paths :** `spec.target.paths` specifies list of file paths to backup.

- **spec.target.volumeMounts :** `spec.target.volumeMounts` are the list of volumes and their `mountPath`s that contain the target file paths. Stash will mount these volumes inside a sidecar container or a backup job.

- **spec.target.snapshotClassName:** `spec.target.snapshotClassName` indicates the [VolumeSnapshotClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshot-classes/) to use for volume snasphotting. Use this field only if `spec.driver` is set to `VolumeSnapshotter`.

#### spec.repository

`spec.repository.name` indicates the `Repository` crd name that holds necessary backend information where the backed up data will be stored.

#### spec.schedule

`spec.schedule` is a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) that specifies the schedule of backup. Stash creates a Kubernetes [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) with this schedule.

#### spec.task

`spec.task` specifies the name and parameters of the [Task](/docs/concepts/crds/task.md) crd to use to backup the target.

- **spec.task.name:** `spec.task.name` indicates the name of the `Task` to use for this backup process.
- **spec.task.params:** `spec.task.params` is an array of custom parameters to use to configure the task.

> `spec.task` section is not required for backing up workload data (i.e. Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet etc.). However, it is necessary for backing up databases and stand-alone PVCs.

#### spec.paused

`spec.paused` can be used as `enable/disable` switch for backup. If it is set `true`, Stash will not take any backup of the target specified by this BackupConfiguration.

#### spec.runtimeSettings

`spec.runtimeSettings` allows to configure runtime environment for the backup sidecar or job. You can specify runtime settings at both pod level and container level.

- **spec.runtimeSettings.container**
  
  `spec.runtimeSettings.container` is used to configure the backup sidecar/job at container level. You can configure the following container level parameters:

| `envFrom`         | This allows to set environment variables to the container that will be created for this function from a Secret or ConfigMap.                                                                                               |

- **spec.runtimeSettings.pod**

  `spec.runtimeSettings.pod` is used to configure backup job in pod level. You can configure the following pod level parameters,

|             Field              |                                                                                                                  Usage                                                                                                                   |

#### spec.tempDir

Stash mounts an `emptyDir` for holding temporary files. It is also used for `caching` for faster backup performance. You can configure the `emptyDir` using `spec.tempDir` section. You can also disable `caching` using this field. The following fields are configurable in `spec.tempDir` section:

- **spec.tempDir.medium :** Specifies the type of storage medium should back this directory.
- **spec.tempDir.sizeLimit :** Maximum limit of storage for this volume.
- **spec.tempDir.disableCaching :** Disable caching while backup. This may negatively impact backup performance. This is set to `false` by default.

#### spec.retentionPolicy

`spec.retentionPolicy` specifies the policy to follow for cleaning old snapshots. Following options are available to configure retention policy:

|    Policy     |  Value  | `restic` forget command flag |                                            Description                                             |

| `name`        | string  |                              | Name of retention policy. You can provide any name.                                                |
| `keepLast`    | integer | --keep-last n                | Never delete the **n** last (most recent) snapshots.                                               |
| `keepHourly`  | integer | --keep-hourly n              | For the last **n** hours in which a snapshot was made, keep only the last snapshot for each hour.  |
| `keepDaily`   | integer | --keep-daily n               | For the last **n** days which have one or more snapshots, only keep the last one for that day.     |

| `keepYearly`  | integer | --keep-yearly n              | For the last **n** years which have one or more snapshots, only keep the last one for that year.   |
| `keepTags`    | array   | --keep-tag <tag>             | Keep all snapshots which have all tags specified by this option (can be specified multiple times). |

| `dryRun`      | bool    | --dry-run                    | Stash will not remove anything but print which snapshots would be removed.                         |
