# Function

## What is Function

A complete backup or restore process may consist of several steps. For example, in order to backup a PostgreSQL database we first need to dump the database and upload the dumped file to a backend. Then we need to update the respective`Repository` and `BackupSession` status and send Prometheus metrics. In Stash, we call such individual steps a `Function`.

A `Function` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition`(CRD) which basically specifies a template for a container that performs only a specific action. For example, `postgres-backup-*` function only dumps and uploads the dumped file into the backend where `update-status` function updates the status of respective `BackupSession` and `Repository` and sends Prometheus metrics to pushgateway based on the output of `postgres-backup-*` function.

When you install Stash, some `Function`s will be pre-installed for supported targets like databases, etc. However, you can create your own function to customize or extend the backup/restore process.

## Function CRD Specification

Like any official Kubernetes resource, a `Function` has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta` and `Spec` sections. However, unlike other Kubernetes resources, it does not have a `Status` section.

A sample `Function` object to backup a PostgreSQL is shown below,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: postgres-backup-11.2
spec:
  image: stashed/postgres-stash:11.2
  args:
  - backup-pg
  - --provider=${REPOSITORY_PROVIDER:=}
  - --bucket=${REPOSITORY_BUCKET:=}
  - --endpoint=${REPOSITORY_ENDPOINT:=}
  - --path=${REPOSITORY_PREFIX:=}
  - --secret-dir=/etc/repository/secret
  - --scratch-dir=/tmp
  - --hostname=${HOSTNAME:=host-0}
  - --pg-args=${pgArgs:=}
  - --namespace=${NAMESPACE:=default}
  - --app-binding=${TARGET_NAME:=}
  - --retention-keep-last=${RETENTION_KEEP_LAST:=0}
  - --retention-prune=${RETENTION_PRUNE:=false}
  - --output-dir=${outputDir:=}
  - --enable-cache=${ENABLE_CACHE:=true}
  - --max-connections=${MAX_CONNECTIONS:=0}
  volumeMounts:
  - name: ${secretVolume}
    mountPath: /etc/repository/secret
  runtimeSettings:
    container:
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 256M
        limits:
          memory: 256M
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 5000
        runAsGroup: 5000
```

A sample `Function` that updates `BackupSession` and `Repository`  status and sends metrics to Prometheus pushgateway is shown below,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: update-status
spec:
  image: appscode/stash:pg
  args:
  - update-status
  - --namespace=${NAMESPACE:=default}
  - --repository=${REPOSITORY_NAME:=}
  - --backup-session=${BACKUP_SESSION:=}
  - --restore-session=${RESTORE_SESSION:=}
  - --output-dir=${outputDir:=}
  - --enable-status-subresource=${ENABLE_STATUS_SUBRESOURCE:=false}
```

Here, we are going to describe the various sections of a `Function` crd.

### Function `Spec`

A `Function` object has the following fields in the `spec` section:

#### spec.image

`spec.image` specifies the docker image to use to create a container using the template specified in this `Function`.

#### spec.command

`spec.command` specifies the commands to be executed by the container. Docker image's `ENTRYPOINT` will be executed if no commands are specified.

#### spec.args

`spec.args` specifies a list of arguments that will be passed to the entrypoint. You can templatize this section using `envsubst` style variables. Stash will resolve all the variables before creating the respective container. A variable should follow the following patterns:

- ${VARIABLE_NAME:=default-value}
- ${VARIABLE_NAME:=}

In the first case, if Stash can't resolve the variable, the default value will be used in place of this variable. In the second case, if Stash can't resolve the variable, an empty string will be used to replace the variable.

##### Stash Provided Variables

Stash operator provides the following built-in variables based on `BackupConfiguration`, `BackupSession`, `RestoreSession`, `Repository`, `Task`, `Function`, `BackupBlueprint` etc.

If you want to use a variable that is not present this table, you have to provide its value in `spec.task.params` section of `BackupConfiguration` crd.

#### spec.workDir

`spec.workDir` specifies the container's working directory. If this field is not specified, the container's runtime default will be used.

#### spec.ports

`spec.ports` specifies a list of the ports to expose from the respective container that will be created for this function.

#### spec.volumeMounts

`spec.volumeMounts` specifies a list of volume names and their `mountPath` that will be mounted into the container that will be created for this function.

#### spec.volumeDevices

`spec.volumeDevices` specifies a list of the block devices to be used by the container that will be created for this function.

#### spec.runtimeSettings

`spec.runtimeSettings.container` allows to configure runtime environment of a backup job at container level. You can configure the following container level parameters:

  |       Field       |                                                                                                           Usage                                                                                                            |
  | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `resources`       | Compute resources required by sidecar container or backup job. To know how to manage resources for containers, please visit [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/). |
  | `livenessProbe`   | Periodic probe of backup sidecar/job container's liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails.                                                                                                                 |
  | `readinessProbe`  | Periodic probe of backup sidecar/job container's readiness. Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails.                                                                                           |
  | `lifecycle`       | Actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events.                                                                                                                                  |
  | `securityContext` | Security options that backup sidecar/job's container should run with. For more details, please visit [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/security-context/).                                                 |
  | `nice`            | Set CPU scheduling priority for the backup process. For more details about `nice`, please visit [here](https://www.askapache.com/optimize/optimize-nice-ionice/#nice).                                                     |
  | `ionice`          | Set I/O scheduling class and priority for the backup process. For more details about `ionice`, please visit [here](https://www.askapache.com/optimize/optimize-nice-ionice/#ionice).                                       |
  | `env`             | A list of the environment variables to set in the container that will be created for this function.                                                                                                                         |
  | `envFrom`         | This allows to set environment variables to the container that will be created for this function from a Secret or ConfigMap.                                                                                               |


#### spec.podSecurityPolicyName

If you are using a [PSP enabled cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) and the function needs any specific permission then you can specify the PSP name using `spec.podSecurityPolicyName` field. Stash will add this PSP in the respective RBAC roles that will be created for this function.

>Note that Stash operator can't give permission to use a PSP to a backup job if the operator itself does not have permission to use it. So, if you want to specify PSP name in this section, make sure to add that in `stash-operator` ClusterRole too.
