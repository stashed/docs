# RestoreSession

## What is RestoreSession

A `RestoreSession` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition`(CRD) which specifies a target to restore and the source of data that will be restored in a Kubernetes native way.

You have to create a `RestoreSession` object whenever you want to restore. When a `RestoreSession` object is created, Stash injects an `init-container` into the target workload and restarts it. The `init-container` restores the desired data. If the target is a database or a stand-alone PVC, Stash launches a job to perform the restore process.

## RestoreSession CRD Specification

Like any official Kubernetes resource, a `RestoreSession` has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta`, `Spec` and `Status` sections.

A sample `RestoreSession` object to restore backed up data of a StatefulSet is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: RestoreSession
metadata:
  name: statefulset-restore
  namespace: demo
spec:
  driver: Restic
  repository:
    name: minio-repo
  # task:
  #   name: workload-restore # task field is not required for workload data backup but it is necessary for database backup.
  target:
    alias: my-sts
    ref:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: StatefulSet
      name: recovered-statefulset
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /source/data
      name: source-data
    rules:
    - targetHosts: ["my-sts-3","my-sts-4"] # "pod-3" and "pod-4" will have restored data of backed up host "pod-1"
      sourceHost: "my-sts-1" # source host
      paths:
      - /source/data
      include:
      - /source/data/*.json
    - targetHosts: [] # empty host match all hosts
      sourceHost: "" # no source host indicates that the host is pod itself
      paths:
      - /source/data
      exclude:

Here, we are going to describe the various sections of a `RestoreSession` object.

### RestoreSession `Spec`

A `RestoreSession` object has the following fields in the `spec` section.

#### spec.driver

`spec.driver` indicates the mechanism used to restore a target. Currently, Stash supports `Restic` and `VolumeSnapshotter` as drivers. The default value of this field is `Restic`.

| Driver              | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Restic`            | Used to restore workload data, persistent volumes data and databases. It uses [restic](https://restic.net) to restore the target.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `VolumeSnapshotter` | Used to initialize PersistentVolumeClaim from VolumeSnapshot. It leverages Kubernetes [VolumeSnapshot](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) crd and CSI driver to initialize the target PVCs from respective snapshots. Currently, it can restore only in the new PVC. |

#### spec.target

`spec.target` field indicates the target where data will be restored. This section consists of the following fields:

- **spec.target.alias :** `spec.target.alias` field specifies the alias that was used as the identifier of the backed up data. It must match with the alias used during backup.

- **spec.target.ref :** `spec.target.ref` refers to the restore target. You have to specify `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `name` of the target. Stash will use this information to inject an `init-container` or to create a restore job.

- **spec.target.volumeMounts :** `spec.target.volumeMounts` specifies a list of volumes and their `mountPath` where the data will be restored. Stash will mount these volumes inside the `init-container` or restore job.

> Note: Stash stores the absolute path of the backed up files. Hence, your restored volume must be mounted on the same `mountPath` as the original volume. Otherwise, the backed up files will not be restored into your desired volume.

- **spec.target.volumeClaimTemplates :** You can specify a list of PVC template using `spec.target.volumeClaimTemplates` field. Stash will create those PVCs then it will restore the desired data into them. Then, you can use those PVCs to deploy your desired workload.

- **spec.target.replicas :** If you want to restore the volumes of a StatefulSet through `spec.target.volumeClaimTemplate` field, you can specify the number of replicas of the StatefulSet using `spec.target.replicas`. In this case, you have to use `${POD_ORDINAL}` variable suffix in the claim name. Stash will replace that variable with respective ordinal and it will create the volumes for each replica. For more details, please visit [here](/docs/guides/latest/advanced-use-case/clone-pvc.md#clone-the-volumes-of-a-satefulset).

- **spec.target.rules :** `spec.target.rules` is an array of restore rules that specify how Stash should restore data for each host. For example, Stash runs the restore process in all pods of a StatefulSet. You can configure this `spec.target.rules` section to control what data will be restored into which pod. Each restore rule has the following fields:

  - **targetHosts :** `targetHosts` field contains a list of host names that are subject to this rule. If `targetHosts` field is empty, this rule applies to all hosts for which there is no specific rule. In the sample `RestoreSession` given above, the first rule applies to only `pod-3` and `pod-4` and the second rule is applicable to all hosts.
  - **sourceHost :** `sourceHost` specifies the name of host whose backed up data will be restored by this rule. In the sample `RestoreSession`, the first rule specifies that backed up data of `pod-0` will be restored into `pod-3` and `pod-4`. If you keep `sourceHost` field empty as the second rule of the above example, data from a similar backup host will be restored on the respective restore host. That means, backed up data of `pod-0` will be restored into `pod-0`, backed up data of `pod-1` will be restored into `pod-1` and so on.
  - **paths :** `paths` specifies a list of file paths that will be restored into the hosts who are subject to this rule.
  - **snapshots :** `snapshots` specifies the list of snapshots that will be restored into the hosts who are subject to this rule. If you don't specify the snapshot field, the latest snapshot of the file paths specified in the `paths` section will be restored.
  - **include :** `include` field specifies a list of patterns for the files that should be restored. Stash only restore the files that match these patterns.
  - **exclude :** `exclude` field specifies a list of patterns for the files that should be ignored during. Stash will not restore the files that match these patterns.

  Restore rules comply with the following conditions:

  - There could be at most one rule with an empty `targetHosts` field.
  - No two rules with non-empty `targetHosts` can't be matched for a single host.
  - Stash restore only one file path in a single snapshot. So, if you specify `snapshots` field in a rule, you can't specify `paths` field as it may cause restore failure if a file path wasn't backed up in the snapshot specified in the `snapshots` field.
  - If no rule matches for a host, no data will be restored on that host.
  - The order of the rules does not have any effect on the restoration process.

#### spec.repository

`spec.repository.name` indicates the `Repository` crd name that holds necessary backend information from where data will be restored.

#### spec.task

`spec.task` specifies the name and parameters of the [Task](/docs/concepts/crds/task.md) crd to use to restore the target data.

- **spec.task.name:** `spec.task.name` indicates the name of the `Task` template to use for this restore process.
- **spec.task.params:** `spec.task.params` is an array of custom parameters to use to configure the task.

> `spec.task` section is not necessary for restoring workload data (i.e. Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet, etc.). However, it is necessary for restoring the database and stand-alone PVC.

#### spec.hooks

`spec.hooks` allows performing some actions before and after the restoration process. You can send HTTP requests to a remote server via `httpGet` or `httpPost` hooks. You can check whether a TCP socket is open using `tcpSocket` hook. You can also execute some commands into your application pod using `exec` hook.

- **spec.hooks.preRestore:** `spec.hooks.preRestore` hooks are executed before the restore process.
- **spec.hooks.postRestore:** `spec.hooks.postRestore` hooks are executed after the restore process.

For more details on how hooks work in Stash and how to configure different types of hook, please visit [here](/docs/guides/latest/hooks/overview.md).

#### spec.runtimeSettings

`spec.runtimeSettings` allows to configure runtime environment for restore `init-container` or job. You can specify runtime settings in both the pod level and container level.

- **spec.runtimeSettings.container**

  `spec.runtimeSettings.container` is used to configure restore init-container/job in container level. You can configure the following container level parameters,

| `readinessGates`               | Specifies additional conditions to be evaluated for Pod readiness. For more details, please visit [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-readiness-gate).                                               |
| `runtimeClassName`             | RuntimeClass is used for selecting the container runtime configuration. For more details, please visit [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/)                                                                  |
| `enableServiceLinks`           | EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services should be injected into pod's environment variables.                                                                                                                          |

#### spec.tempDir

Stash mounts an `emptyDir` for holding temporary files. It is also used for `caching` for faster restore performance. You can configure the `emptyDir` using `spec.tempDir` section. You can also disable `caching` using this field. The following fields are configurable in `spec.tempDir` section:

- **spec.tempDir.medium :** Specifies the type of storage medium should back this file path.
- **spec.tempDir.sizeLimit :** Maximum limit of storage for this volume.
- **spec.tempDir.disableCaching :** Disable caching while restoring. This may negatively impact restore performance. This field is set to `false` by default.

#### spec.interimVolumeTemplate

For some targets (i.e. some databases), Stash can't directly pipe the restored data into the target. In this case, it has to store the restored data temporarily before injecting into the target. `spec.interimVolumeTemplate` specifies a PVC template for holding those data temporarily. Stash will create a PVC according to the template and use it to store the data temporarily. This PVC will be deleted automatically if you delete the `RestoreSession`.

>Note that the usage of this field is different from `spec.tempDir` which is used for caching purpose. Stash has introduced this field because the `emptyDir` volume that is used for `spec.tempDir` does not play nice with large databases( i.e. 100Gi database). Also, it provides debugging capability as Stash keeps it until you delete the `RestoreSession`.

### RestoreSession `Status`

`.status` section of `RestoreSession` shows progress, stats, and overall phase of the restore process. The restore init-container or job adds its respective stats in `.status` section after it completes its task. `.status` section consists of the following fields:

#### status.totalHosts

Not every pod or replica of the target will run the restore process. Thus, we refer those entities that run the restore process as a host. `status.totalHosts` specifies the total number of hosts that will run the restore process for this RestoreSession. For more details on how many hosts will run restore process for which types of workload, please visit [here](#hosts-of-a-restore-process).

#### status.phase

`status.phase` indicates the overall phase of the restore process for this RestoreSession. `status.phase` will be `Succeeded` only if the phase of all hosts are `Succeeded`. If any of the hosts fail to complete restore, `status.phase` will be `Failed`.

#### status.sessionDuration

`status.sessionDuration` indicates the total time taken to complete the restoration of all hosts.

#### status.conditions

`status.conditions` shows the conditions of various steps of the restore process. Stash sets the following conditions for a RestoreSession:

| Condition Type               | Usage                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RepositoryFound`            | Indicates whether the respective Repository object was found or not.                                                                           |
| `BackendSecretFound`         | Indicates whether the respective backend secret was found or not.                                                                              |
| `RestoreTargetFound`         | Indicates whether the restore target was found or not.                                                                                         |
| `StashInitContainerInjected` | Indicates whether stash init-container was injected into the targeted workload or not. This condition is applicable only in the sidecar model. |
| `RestoreJobCreated`          | Indicates whether the restore job was created or not. This condition is applicable only in the job model.                                      |

#### status.stats

`status.stats` section is an array of restore statistics of individual hosts. Each host adds their statistics in this array after completing their restore process. This field is only available for the `Restic` driver but not available for the `VolumeSnapshotter` driver. The default value of the driver is `Restic`.

Individual host stats entry consists of the following fields:

- **hostname :** `hostname` indicates the name of the host. Usually, it is the `alias` or `alias-<workload-specific-suffix>`. For more details, please visit [here](/docs/concepts/crds/backupsession.md#hosts-of-a-backup-process).
- **phase :** `phase` indicates the restore phase of this host.
- **duration :** `duration` indicates the total time taken to complete the restore process for this host.
- **error :** `error` shows the reason for failure if the restore process fails for this host.
