# Using Kube2iam with Stash on Amazon EKS

This guide will show you how to use Kube2iam of [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) with Stash. Here, we are going to backup a MariaDB database and store the backed up data into a [AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).Then, we are going to show how to restore this backed up data.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have an EKS cluster. If you don't already have a cluster, create one from [here](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).
- Install `Stash` in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).
- Install `KubeDB` operator in your cluster following the steps [here](https://kubedb.com/docs/latest/setup/).
- Install [Kube2iam](https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam) in your cluster.
- You should be familiar with the following `Stash` concepts:
  - [BackupConfiguration](/docs/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration/index.md)
  - [BackupSession](/docs/concepts/crds/backupsession/index.md)
  - [RestoreSession](/docs/concepts/crds/restoresession/index.md)
  - [Repository](/docs/concepts/crds/repository/index.md)
- You will need a [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store the backup snapshots.
- Install `eksctl` following the steps [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html).

To keep everything isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Setting up the Roles and Policies in AWS

### Create IAM Policy

We need an IAM policy for accessing S3 buckets. Below is the `JSON`of the IAM policy we are going to create,

```bash
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Let's navigate to the IAM management console to create a policy `bucket-accessor` with full access permission to S3 buckets.

  <img alt="Review IAM policy" src="/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/images/create-bucket-policy-2.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Review IAM policy</figcaption>
</figure>

### Create Role

Now, let's create an IAM role `bucket-accessor` attaching the above IAM policy,

<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Create IAM role (Step: 1)" src="/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/images/create-role-1.png">

  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Create IAM Role (Step: 3)</figcaption>
</figure>

### Configure Roles

We need to add the policy to allow our Kubernete worker nodes to assume roles that are not in their default role. We are going to create a new IAM policy `assume-policy` and attach it with the existing node role so that it can assume the role for accessing the bucket. Below is the `JSON` of the IAM policy we are going to create,

```bash
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "sts:AssumeRole"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/bucket-accessor"
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's navigate to the IAM management console to create `assume-policy`,

<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Create IAM policy (Step: 1)" src="/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/images/create-assume-policy-1.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Create IAM policy (Step: 1)</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Create IAM policy(Step: 2) " src="/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/images/create-assume-policy-2.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Create IAM policy (Step: 2)</figcaption>
</figure>

Now, let's attach the IAM policy to our exisiting node role,
<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Attach IAM policy(Step: 1" src="/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/images/attach-policy-1.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Attach Policy (Step: 1)</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Attach IAM policy(Step: 2" src="/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/images/attach-policy-2.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Attach Policy (Step: 2)</figcaption>
</figure>

The `bucket-accessor` role needs the trust policy to trust the node role. Below is the `JSON` of the trust policy we are going to use,

```bash
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/kubernetes-node"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

Lets update the trust policy of `bucket-accessor` role,

  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Update Trust Policy (Step: 2)</figcaption>
</figure>

## Prepare MariaDB

In this section, we are going to deploy a MariaDB database using KubeDB. Then, we are going to insert some sample data into it.

### Deploy MariaDB using KubeDB

At first, let’s deploy a MariaDB standalone database named `sample-mariadb` using KubeDB,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: sample-mariadb
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "10.5.8"
  replicas: 1
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/examples/mariadb.yaml
mariadb.kubedb.com/sample-mariadb created
```

Now, wait for the database pod `sample-mariadb-0` to go into Running state,

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n demo sample-mariadb-0
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sample-mariadb-0   1/1     Running   0          29m
```

Once the database pod is in Running state, verify that the database is ready to accept the connections.

```bash
$ kubectl logs -n demo sample-mariadb-0
2021-02-22  9:41:37 0 [Note] Reading of all Master_info entries succeeded
2021-02-22  9:41:37 0 [Note] Added new Master_info '' to hash table
2021-02-22  9:41:37 0 [Note] mysqld: ready for connections.
Version: '10.5.8-MariaDB-1:10.5.8+maria~focal'  socket: '/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'  port: 3306  mariadb.org binary distribution
```

From the above log, we can see the database is ready to accept connections.

### Insert Sample Data

Now, we are going to exec into the database pod and create some sample data. The sample-mariadb object creates a secret containing the credentials of MariaDB and set them as pod’s Environment varibles `MYSQL_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

Here, we are going to use the root user (`MYSQL_ROOT_USERNAME`) credential `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` to insert the sample data. Let’s exec into the database pod and insert some sample data,

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it -n demo sample-mariadb-0 -- bash
root@sample-mariadb-0:/ mysql -u${MYSQL_ROOT_USERNAME} -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}

| James William |   7000 |
+---------------+--------+
2 rows in set (0.001 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> exit
Bye
```

We have successfully deployed a MariaDB database and inserted some sample data into it.

## Prepare Backup

In this section, we are going to prepare the necessary resources (i.e. database connection information, backend information, etc.) before backup.

### Verify Stash MariaDB Addon Installed

When you install the Stash Enterprise edition, it automatically installs all the official database addons. Verify that it has installed the MariaDB addons using the following command.

```bash
$ kubectl get tasks.stash.appscode.com | grep mariadb
mariadb-backup-10.5.8    35s
mariadb-restore-10.5.8   35s
```

### Ensure AppBinding

Stash needs to know how to connect with the database. An `AppBinding` exactly provides this information. It holds the Service and Secret information of the database. You have to point to the respective `AppBinding` as a target of backup instead of the database itself.

Stash expect your database Secret to have `username` and `password` keys. If your database secret does not have them, the `AppBinding` can also help here. You can specify a `secretTransforms` section with the mapping between the current keys and the desired keys.

You don’t need to worry about appbindings if you are using KubeDB. It creates an appbinding containing the necessary informations when you deploy the database. Let’s ensure the appbinding create by `KubeDB` operator.

```bash
$ kubectl get appbinding -n demo 
NAME             TYPE                 VERSION   AGE
sample-mariadb   kubedb.com/mariadb   10.5.8      62m
```

We have a appbinding named same as database name sample-mariadb. We will use this later for connecting into this database.

### Prepare Backend

We are going to store our backed up data into a [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). As we are using Kube2iam, we don't need the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to access the S3 bucket.

At first, we need to create a secret with a Restic password. Then, we have to create a `Repository` crd that will hold the information about our backend storage.

**Create Secret:**

Let's create a secret called `encryption-secret` with the Restic password,

```bash
$ echo -n 'changeit' > RESTIC_PASSWORD
$ kubectl create secret generic -n demo encryption-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
secret "encryption-secret" created
```

**Create Repository:**

Now, let's create a `Repository` with the information of our desired S3 bucket. Below is the YAML of `Repository` crd we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: s3-repo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backend:
    s3:
      endpoint: 's3.amazonaws.com'
      bucket: stash-qa
      region: us-east-1
      prefix: /demo/mariadb
    storageSecretName: encryption-secret

```

Let's create the `Repository` we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/examples/repository.yaml
repository.stash.appscode.com/gcs-repo created
```

Now, we are ready to backup our sample data into this backend.

## Backup

To schedule a backup, we have to create a `BackupConfiguration` object targeting the respective AppBinding of our desired database. Then Stash will create a CronJob to periodically backup the database.

**Create BackupConfiguration:**

Below is the `YAML` for BackupConfiguration object we are going to use to backup the sample-mariadb database we have deployed earlier,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: sample-mariadb-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  runtimeSettings:
    pod:
      podAnnotations:
        iam.amazonaws.com/role: arn:aws:iam::452618475015:role/bucket-accessor
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  repository:
    name: s3-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: sample-mariadb
  retentionPolicy:
    name: keep-last-5
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

Here,

- `spec.runtimeSettins.pod.podAnnotations` refers to the annotations that will be attached with the respective pod.
- `spec.repository` refers to the `Repository` object `gcs-repo` that holds backend [GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) information.
- `spec.target.ref`refers to the AppBinding object that holds the connection information of our targeted database.

> Notice the `spec.runtimeSettings.pod` section. We are now passing the respective IAM annotation via `podAnnotations` field. Stash will pass this annotation to the respective backup pod.

Let's create the `BackupConfiguration` crd we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/examples/backupconfiguration.yaml
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-mariadb-backup created
```

**Verify Backup Setup Successful:**

If everything goes well, the phase of the `BackupConfiguration` should be `Ready`. The `Ready` phase indicates that the backup setup is successful. Let’s verify the Phase of the `BackupConfiguration`,

```bash
$ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo
NAME                    TASK                    SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE      AGE
sample-mariadb-backup   mariadb-backup-10.5.8   */5 * * * *            Ready      11s
```

**Verify CronJob:**

Stash will create a CronJob with the schedule specified in `spec.schedule` field of `BackupConfiguration` object.

Verify that the CronJob has been created using the following command,

```bash
$ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                                 SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-mariadb-backup   */5 * * * *   False     0        15s             17s
```

**Wait for BackupSession:**

The `sample-mariadb-backup` CronJob will trigger a backup on each scheduled slot by creating a `BackupSession` object.

Now, wait for a schedule to appear. Run the following command to watch for a `BackupSession` object,

```bash
$ kubectl get backupsession -n demo -w
NAME                               INVOKER-TYPE          INVOKER-NAME            PHASE     AGE
sample-mariadb-backup-1606994706   BackupConfiguration   sample-mariadb-backup   Running   24s
sample-mariadb-backup-1606994706   BackupConfiguration   sample-mariadb-backup   Running   75s
sample-mariadb-backup-1606994706   BackupConfiguration   sample-mariadb-backup   Succeeded   103s

```

Here, the phase `Succeeded` means that the backup process has been completed successfully.

**Verify Backup:**

Now, we are going to verify whether the backed up data is present in the backend or not. Once a backup is completed, Stash will update the respective `Repository` object to reflect the backup completion. Check that the repository `gcs-repo` has been updated by the following command,

```bash
$ kubectl get repository -n demo gcs-repo
NAME       INTEGRITY   SIZE        SNAPSHOT-COUNT   LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP   AGE
gcs-repo   true        1.327 MiB   1                60s                      8m
```

Now, if we navigate to the GCS bucket, we will see the backed up data has been stored in `demo/mariadb/sample-mariadb` directory as specified by `.spec.backend.gcs.prefix` field of the Repository object.

<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Backup data in GCS Bucket" src="/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/images/gcs.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Backup data in GCS Bucket</figcaption>
</figure>

> **Note:** Stash keeps all the backed up data encrypted. So, data in the backend will not make any sense until they are decrypted.

## Restore

In this section, we are going to show you how to restore in the same database which may be necessary when you have accidentally deleted any data from the running database.

**Temporarily Pause Backup:**

At first, let's stop taking any further backup of the database so that no backup runs after we delete the sample data. We are going to pause the `BackupConfiguration` object. Stash will stop taking any further backup when the `BackupConfiguration` is paused.

Let's pause the `sample-mariadb-backup` BackupConfiguration,

```bash
$ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n demo sample-mariadb-backup--type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": true}}'
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-mgo-rs-backup patched
```

Or you can use the Stash `kubectl` plugin to pause the `BackupConfiguration`,

```bash
$ kubectl stash pause backup -n demo --backupconfig=sample-mariadb-backup
BackupConfiguration demo/sample-mariadb-backup has been paused successfully.
```

Verify that the `BackupConfiguration` has been paused,

```bash
$ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo sample-mariadb-backup
NAME                   TASK                    SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
sample-mariadb-backup  mariadb-backup-10.5.8   */5 * * * *   true     Ready   26m
```

Notice the `PAUSED` column. Value `true` for this field means that the `BackupConfiguration` has been paused.

Stash will also suspend the respective CronJob.

```bash
$ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                                 SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-mariadb-backup   */5 * * * *   True      0        2m59s           20m
```

**Simulate Disaster:**

Now, let's simulate an accidental deletion scenario. Here, we are going to exec into the database pod and delete the `company` database we had created earlier.

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it -n demo sample-mariadb-0 -c mariadb -- bash
root@sample-mariadb-0:/ mysql -u${MYSQL_ROOT_USERNAME} -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}

MariaDB [(none)]> exit
Bye
```

**Create RestoreSession:**

To restore the database, you have to create a `RestoreSession` object pointing to the `AppBinding` of the targeted database.

Here, is the `YAML` of the `RestoreSession` object that we are going to use for restoring our `sample-mariadb` database.

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: RestoreSession
metadata:
  name: sample-mariadb-restore
  namespace: demo
spec:
  runtimeSettings:
    pod:
      podAnnotations:
        iam.amazonaws.com/role: "arn:aws:iam::452618475015:role/bucket-accessor"
  repository:
    name: s3-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: sample-mariadb
  rules:
  - snapshots: [latest]

```

> Notice the `spec.runtimeSettings.pod` section. We are now passing the respective IAM annotation via `podAnnotations` field. Stash will pass this annotation to the respective backup pod.

Here,

- `spec.runtimeSettins.pod.podAnnotations` refers to the annotations that will be attached with the respective pod.
- `spec.repository.name` specifies the Repository object that holds the backend information where our backed up data has been stored.
- `spec.target.ref` refers to the respective AppBinding of the `sample-mariadb` database.
- `spec.rules` specifies that we are restoring data from the latest backup snapshot of the database.

Let's create the `RestoreSession` object object we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/platforms/eks-kube2iam/examples/restoresession.yaml
restoresession.stash.appscode.com/sample-mariadb-restore created
```

Once, you have created the `RestoreSession` object, Stash will create a restore Job. Run the following command to watch the phase of the `RestoreSession` object,

```bash
$ kubectl get restoresession -n demo -w
NAME                     REPOSITORY   PHASE     AGE
sample-mariadb-restore   gcs-repo     Running   15s
sample-mariadb-restore   gcs-repo     Succeeded   18s
```

The `Succeeded` phase means that the restore process has been completed successfully.

**Verify Restored Data:**

Now, let's exec into the database pod and verify whether data actual data was restored or not,

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it -n demo sample-mariadb-0 -c mariadb -- bash
root@sample-mariadb-0:/ mysql -u${MYSQL_ROOT_USERNAME} -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}

Hence, we can see from the above output that the deleted data has been restored successfully from the backup.

**Resume Backup**

Since our data has been restored successfully we can now resume our usual backup process. Resume the `BackupConfiguration` using following command,
```bash
$ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n demo sample-mariadb-backup --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": false}}'
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-mariadb-backup patched
```

Or you can use the Stash `kubectl` plugin to resume the `BackupConfiguration`,
```bash
$ kubectl stash resume -n demo --backupconfig=sample-mariadb-backup
BackupConfiguration demo/sample-mariadb-backup has been resumed successfully.
```

Verify that the `BackupConfiguration` has been resumed,
```bash
$ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo sample-mariadb-backup
NAME                    TASK                    SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
sample-mariadb-backup   mariadb-backup-10.5.8   */5 * * * *   false    Ready   29m
```

Here,  `false` in the `PAUSED` column means the backup has been resume successfully. The CronJob also should be resumed now.

```bash
$ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                                 SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-mariadb-backup   */5 * * * *   False     0        2m59s           29m
```

Here, `False` in the `SUSPEND` column means the CronJob is no longer suspended and will trigger in the next schedule.

### Cleanup
