# Auto Backup for Database

This tutorial will give you an overview of how you can configure Stash auto-backup of the databases and the available configurable options for database auto-backup.

## Configuring auto-backup for databases

To configure auto-backup for a database, you have to follow the following steps:

- **Create BackupBlueprint:** At first, you have to create a `BackupBlueprint` with the template for `Repository` and `BackupConfiguration`. Use the appropriate `Task` in the `task` section.
- **Create Storage Secret:** Then, you have to create a storage Secret in the same namespace as your database with the access credential to your backend. You can re-use this secret to backup the other databases in that namespace.
- **Add auto-backup annotations:** Finally, add the auto-backup annotations to your database object or the respective `AppBinding` object.

## Where to put auto-backup annotations

If you are using KubeDB to manage your databases, you can add the annotations to your database object. KubeDB will automatically pass those annotations to the respective `AppBinding`.

If you are not managing your database using KubeDB, you have to add the annotation in the respective `AppBinding` that you have created for your database.

## Available Auto-Backup Annotations for Database

The following auto-backup annotations are available for the databases:

- **BackupBlueprint Name:** You have to specify the `BackupBlueprint` name that holds the template for `Repository` and `BackupConfiguration` in the following annotation:

```yaml
stash.appscode.com/backup-blueprint: <BackupBlueprint name>
```

- **Schedule:** You can specify a custom schedule for a target to overwrite the schedule of the BackupBlueprint through this annotation.

```yaml
 stash.appscode.com/schedule: <Cron Expression>
```

- **Task Parameters:** You can also pass some parameters to the respective backup `Task` through annotations. Use following format to pass parameters via annotations:

```yaml
params.stash.appscode.com/key1: value1
params.stash.appscode.com/key2: value2,value3
params.stash.appscode.com/key3: ab=123,bc=234
```

The above parameters will be added in the `spec.task.params` section as bellow,

```yaml
task:
  name: postgres-backup-13.1-v1
  params:
  - name: key1
    value: value1
  - name: key2
    value: value3,value3
  - name: key3
    value: ab=123,bc=234
```
