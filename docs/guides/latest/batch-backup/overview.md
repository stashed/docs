# Batch Backup and Restore Overview

Sometimes, an application may consist of multiple co-related components. For example, to deploy a WordPress, you will need a Deployment for the WordPress and another Deployment for the database. Now, it is sensible to want to backup or restore both of the deployments using a single configuration as they are parts of the same application.

Stash 0.9.0+ supports taking backup multiple co-related components using a single configuration known as [BackupBatch](/docs/concepts/crds/backupbatch.md). Stash 0.10.0+ supports restoring multiple co-related components together known as [RestoreBatch](/docs/concepts/crds/restorebatch.md) This guide will give you an overview of how batch backup and restore works in Stash.

## How Batch Backup Works

The following diagram shows how Stash takes backup of multiple co-related components in a single application. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The backup process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a backend Secret. This secret holds the credentials to access the backend where the backed up data will be stored.

2. Then, she creates a `Repository` crd which represents the original repository in the backend.

3. Then, she creates a `BackupBatch` crd which specifies multiple targets(workload, volume, and database). It also specifies the `Repository` object that holds the backend information where the backed up data will be stored.

4. Stash operator watches for `BackupBatch` objects.

5. When it finds a `BackupBatch` object, it checks if there is any workload as a target. If there any, it injects a sidecar named `stash` into the workloads.

6. It also creates a `CronJob` to trigger backups periodically.

7. The`CronJob` triggers backup on each scheduled slot by creating a `BackupSession` crd.

8. The BackupSession controller (inside sidecar for sidecar model or inside the operator itself for job model) watches for `BackupSession` crd.

9. When it finds a `BackupSession` it starts the backup process immediately(for job model a job is created for taking backup) for the individual targets. Stash operator enforces the backup order if the `executionOrder` is set to `Sequential`.

10. The individual targets complete their backup process independently and update their respective fields in `BackupSession` status.

## How Batch Restore Works

The following diagram shows the batch restore process. Please, open image in new tab to view the enlarged image.

The batch restore process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, the user creates a `RestoreBatch` CR specifying the targets and the respective Repository where the backed up data has been stored.
2. The Stash operator watches for the `RestoreBatch` CR.
3. When the Stash operator finds a `RestoreBatch` CR, it executes the global `PreRestore` hooks. If there is no global `PreRestore` hook, Stash will skip this step.
4. Then, it injects an init-container into the target that follows the sidecar model and creates a restore job for the targets that follow the job model. Stash operator enforces the restore order in this step if the `executionOrder` is set to `Sequential`.
5. The restore init-container/job first execute their local `PreRestore` hooks. Then, restore their data and finally execute their `PostRestore` hooks.
6. Finally, Stash operator executes the global `PostRestore` hooks. If there is not global `PostRestore` hook configured for this RestoreBatch, Stash will skip this step.
