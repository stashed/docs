# Backup Stand-alone PVC using Stash

This guide will show you how to backup a stand-alone PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) using Stash. Here, we are going to backup a PVC provisioned using an NFS server into a GCS bucket.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- Install `Stash` in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/install.md).

- You will need to have a PVC with `ReadWriteMany` access mode. Here, we are going to use an NFS server to provision a PVC with `ReadWriteMany` access mode. If you don't have an NFS server running, deploy one by following the guide [here](https://github.com/appscode/third-party-tools/blob/master/storage/nfs/README.md).

- You should be familiar with the following `Stash` concepts:
  - [BackupConfiguration](/docs/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration.md)
  - [BackupSession](/docs/concepts/crds/backupsession.md)
  - [Repository](/docs/concepts/crds/repository.md)
  - [RestoreSession](/docs/concepts/crds/restoresession.md)
  - [Function](/docs/concepts/crds/function.md)
  - [Task](/docs/concepts/crds/task.md)

To keep everything isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```console
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

> **Note:** YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/examples/guides/latest/volumes](/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumes) directory of [stashed/docs](https://github.com/stashed/docs) repository.

**Verify necessary Function and Task:**

Stash uses a `Function-Task` model to backup stand-alone volume. When you install Stash, it automatically creates the necessary `Function` and `Task` to backup a stand-alone volume.

Let's verify that Stash has created the necessary `Function` to backup/restore PVC by the following command,

```console
$ kubectl get function
NAME            AGE
pvc-backup      117m
pvc-restore     117m
update-status   117m
```

Also, verify that the necessary `Task` has been created,

```console
$ kubectl get task
NAME          AGE
pvc-backup    118m
pvc-restore   118m
```

## Prepare Volume

At first, let's prepare our desired PVC. Here, we are going to create a [PersistentVolume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PV) that will use an NFS server as storage. Then, we are going to create a PVC that will bind with the PV. Then, we are going to mount this PVC in two different pods. Each pod will generate a sample file into the PVC.

**Create PersistentVolume:**

We have deployed an NFS server in `storage` namespace and it is accessible through a Service named `nfs-service`. Now, we are going to create a PV that uses the NFS server as storage.

Below is the YAML of the PV that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv
  labels:
    app: nfs-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  nfs:
    server: "nfs-service.storage.svc.cluster.local"
    path: "/"
```

Notice the `metadata.labels` section. Here, we have added `app: nfs-demo` label. We are going to use this label as selector in PVC so that the PVC binds with this PV.

Let's create the PV we have shown above,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumes/pv.yaml
persistentvolume/nfs-pv created
```

**Create PersistentVolumeClaim:**

Now, create a PVC to bind with the PV we have just created. Below, is the YAML of the PVC that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: nfs-pvc
  namespace: demo
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: ""
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nfs-demo
```

Notice the `spec.accessModes` section. We are using `ReadWriteMany` access mode so that multiple pods can use this PVC simultaneously. Without this access mode, Stash will fail to backup the volume if any other pod mount it during backup.

Also, notice the `spec.selector` section. We have specified `app: nfs-demo` labels as a selector so that it binds with the PV that we have created earlier.

Let's create the PVC we have shown above,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumes/pvc.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/nfs-pvc created
```

Verify that the PVC has bounded with our desired PV,

```console
$ kubectl get pvc -n demo nfs-pvc
NAME      STATUS   VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
nfs-pvc   Bound    nfs-pv   1Gi        RWX                           32s
```

Here, we can see that the PVC `nfs-pvc` has been bounded with PV `nfs-pv`.

**Deploy Workload:**

Now, we are going to deploy two sample pods `demo-pod-1` and `demo-pod-2` that will mount `pod-1/data` and `pod-2/data` [subPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#using-subpath) of the `nfs-pvc` respectively. Each of the pods will generate a sample file named `hello.txt` with some demo data. We are going to backup the entire PVC using Stash that contains the sample files.

Below, is the YAML of the first pod that we are going to deploy,

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo-pod-1
  namespace: demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c","echo 'hello from pod 1.' > /sample/data/hello.txt && sleep 3000"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-volume
      mountPath: /sample/data
      subPath: pod-1/data
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: nfs-pvc
```

Here, we have mounted `pod-1/data` directory of the `nfs-pvc` into `/sample/data` directory of this pod.

Let's deploy the pod we have shown above,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumes/pod-1.yaml
pod/demo-pod-1 created
```

Verify that the sample data has been generated into `/sample/data/` directory,

```console
$ kubectl exec -n demo demo-pod-1 cat /sample/data/hello.txt
hello from pod 1.
```

Below is the YAML of the second pod that we are going to deploy,

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo-pod-2
  namespace: demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c","echo 'hello from pod 2.' > /sample/data/hello.txt && sleep 3000"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-volume
      mountPath: /sample/data
      subPath: pod-2/data
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: nfs-pvc
```

Now, we have mounted `pod-2/data` directory of the `nfs-pvc` into `/sample/data` directory of this pod.

Let's create the pod we have shown above,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumes/pod-2.yaml
pod/demo-pod-2 created
```

Verify that the sample data has been generated into `/sample/data/` directory,

```console
$ kubectl exec -n demo demo-pod-2 cat /sample/data/hello.txt
hello from pod 2.
```

## Backup

Now, we are going to backup the PVC `nfs-pvc` in a GCS bucket using Stash. We have to create a Secret and a `Repository` object with access credentials and backend information respectively.

> For GCS backend, if the bucket does not exist, Stash needs `Storage Object Admin` role permissions to create the bucket. For more details, please check the following [guide](/docs/guides/latest/backends/gcs.md).

**Create Storage Secret:**

Let's create a Secret named `gcs-secret` with access credentials of our desired GCS backend,

```console
$ echo -n 'changeit' > RESTIC_PASSWORD
$ echo -n '<your-project-id>' > GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
$ cat /path/to/downloaded/sa_key_file.json > GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
$ kubectl create secret generic -n demo gcs-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
secret/gcs-secret created
```

**Create Repository:**

Now, create a `Repository` crd specifying the desired bucket, and directory inside the bucket where the backed up data will be stored.

Below is the YAML of `Repository` crd that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: gcs-repo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: appscode-qa
      prefix: stash-backup/volumes/nfs-pvc
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
```

Let's create the `Repository` object that we have shown above,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumes/repository.yaml
repository.stash.appscode.com/gcs-repo created
```

We are ready to start taking backup. Now, we have to create a `BackupConfiguration` object targeting `nfs-pvc`.

**Create BackupConfiguration:**

Below is the YAML of the `BackupConfiguration` object that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: nfs-pvc-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  task:
    name: pvc-backup
  repository:
    name: gcs-repo
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      name: nfs-pvc
  retentionPolicy:
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

Here,

- `spec.task.name` specifies the name of the `Task` object that specifies the `Function` and their order of execution to perform a backup of a stand-alone PVC.
- `spec.repository.name` specifies the name of the `Repository` object that holds the backend information where the backed up data has been stored.
- `spec.target.ref` refers to the targeted PVC that will be backed up.

Let's create the `BackupConfiguration` object that we have shown above,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumes/backupconfiguration.yaml
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/nfs-pvc-backup created
```

If everything goes well, Stash will create a CronJob to trigger backup periodically.

**Verify CronJob:**

Verify that Stash has created a CronJob to trigger a periodic backup of the targeted PVC by the following command,

```console
$ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME             SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
nfs-pvc-backup   */5 * * * *   False     0        <none>          28s
```

**Wait for BackupSession:**

Now, wait for the next backup schedule. You can watch for `BackupSession` crd using the following command,

```console
$ watch -n 1 kubectl get backupsession -n demo -l=stash.appscode.com/backup-configuration=nfs-pvc-backup

Every 1.0s: kubectl get backupsession -n demo -l=stash.appscode.com/backup-...  workstation: Wed Jul  3 19:53:13 2019

NAME                        INVOKER-TYPE          INVOKER-NAME     PHASE       AGE
nfs-pvc-backup-1562161802   BackupConfiguration   nfs-pvc-backup   Succeeded   3m11s
```

> Note: Respective CronJob creates `BackupSession` crd with the following label: `stash.appscode.com/backup-configuration=<BackupConfiguration crd name>`. We can use this label to watch only the `BackupSession` of our desired `BackupConfiguration`.

**Verify Backup:**

When backup session is completed, Stash will update the respective `Repository` to reflect the latest state of backed up data.

Run the following command to check if a backup snapshot has been stored in the backend,

```console
$ kubectl get repository -n demo gcs-repo
NAME       INTEGRITY   SIZE   SNAPSHOT-COUNT   LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP   AGE
gcs-repo   true        80 B   1                25s                      49m
```

From the output above, we can see that 1 snapshot has been stored in the backend specified by Repository `gcs-repo`.

If we navigate to `stash-backup/volumes/nfs-pvc` directory of our GCS bucket, we are going to see that the snapshot has been stored there.

  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Backed up data of a stand-alone PVC in GCS backend</figcaption>
</figure>

> Stash keeps all backup data encrypted. So, snapshot files in the bucket will not contain any meaningful data until they are decrypted.

## Restore

This section will show you how to restore the backed up data inside a stand-alone PVC using stash. Here, we are going to restore the data we have backed up in the previous section.

**Stop Taking Backup of the PVC:**

At first, let's stop taking any further backup of the PVC so that no backup is taken during the restore process. We are going to pause the `BackupConfiguration` that we created to backup the `nfs-pvc` PVC. Then, Stash will stop taking any further backup for this PVC. You can learn more how to pause a scheduled backup [here](/docs/guides/latest/advanced-use-case/pause-backup.md).

Let's pause the `nfs-pvc-backup` BackupConfiguration,

```console
$ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n demo nfs-pvc-backup --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": true}}'
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/nfs-pvc-backup patched
```

Now, wait for a moment. Stash will pause the BackupConfiguration. Verify that the BackupConfiguration  has been paused,

```console
$ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo nfs-pvc-backup
NAME             TASK   SCHEDULE      PAUSED   AGE
nfs-pvc-backup          */1 * * * *   true     20m
```

Notice the `PAUSED` column. Value `true` for this field means that the BackupConfiguration has been paused.

**Simulate Disaster:**

At first, let's simulate a disaster scenario. Let's delete all the files from the PVC.

Delete the data of pod `demo-pod-1`:

```console
# delete data
$ kubectl exec -n demo demo-pod-1 -- sh -c "rm /sample/data/*"

# verify that data has been removed successfully
$ kubectl exec -n demo demo-pod-1 ls /sample/data/
# empty output which means all the files have been deleted
```

Delete the data of pod `demo-pod-2`:

```console
# delete data
$ kubectl exec -n demo demo-pod-2 -- sh -c "rm /sample/data/*"

# verify that data has been removed successfully
$ kubectl exec -n demo demo-pod-2 ls /sample/data/
# empty output which means all the files have been deleted
```

**Create RestoreSession:**

Now, we are going to create a `RestoreSession` object to restore the backed up data into the desired PVC. Below is the YAML of the `RestoreSession` object that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: RestoreSession
metadata:
  name: nfs-pvc-restore
  namespace: demo
spec:
  task:
    name: pvc-restore
  repository:
    name: gcs-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      name: nfs-pvc
  rules:
  - snapshots: ["latest"]
```

- `spec.task.name` specifies the name of the `Task` object that specifies the `Function` and their order of execution to restore data inside a stand-alone PVC.
- `spec.target.ref` refers to the targeted PVC where the data will be restored.
- `spec.rules[*].snapshots` specifies that we want to restore the latest snapshot of the `nfs-pvc`.

Let's create the `RestoreSession` object that we have shown above,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumes/restoresession.yaml
restoresession.stash.appscode.com/nfs-pvc-restore created
```

**Wait for RestoreSession to Succeed:**

Now, wait for the restore process to complete. You can watch the `RestoreSession` phase using the following command,

```console
$ watch -n 1 kubectl get restoresession -n demo nfs-pvc-restore

Every 1.0s: kubectl get restoresession -n demo nfs-pvc-restore                  workstation: Wed Jul  3 20:10:52 2019
NAME              REPOSITORY-NAME   PHASE       AGE
nfs-pvc-restore   gcs-repo          Succeeded   32s
```

From the output of the above command, we can see that restoration process has been completed successfully.

**Verify Restored Data:**

Let's verify if the deleted files have been restored successfully into the PVC. We are going to exec into individual pod and check whether the sample data exist or not.

Verify that the data of `demo-pod-1` has been restored:

```console
$ kubectl exec -n demo demo-pod-1 cat /sample/data/hello.txt
hello from pod 1.
```

Verify that the data of `demo-pod-2` has been restored:

```console
$ kubectl exec -n demo demo-pod-2 cat /sample/data/hello.txt
hello from pod 2.
```

So, we can see from the above output that the files we had deleted in **Simulate Disaster** section have been restored successfully.

## Cleanup

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```console
kubectl delete backupconfiguration -n demo nfs-pvc-backup
kubectl delete restoresession -n demo nfs-pvc-restore

kubectl delete secret -n demo gcs-secret
kubectl delete repository -n demo gcs-repo

kubectl delete pod -n demo demo-pod-1
kubectl delete pod -n demo demo-pod-2

kubectl delete pvc -n demo nfs-pvc
kubectl delete pv -n demo nfs-pv
```
