# Snapshotting the volumes of a Deployment

This guide will show you how to use Stash to snapshot the volumes of a Deployment and restore them from snapshot using Kubernetes [VolumeSnapshot](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) API. In this guide, we are going to backup the volumes in Google Cloud Platform with the help of [GCE Persistent Disk CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gcp-compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver).

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to be familiar with the [GCE Persistent Disk CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gcp-compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver).
- You need to enable the Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshotDataSource` alpha feature via Kubernetes feature gates
  - `--feature-gates=VolumeSnapshotDataSource=true`
- Install `Stash` in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/install.md).
- If you don't know how VolumeSnapshot works in Stash, please visit [here](/docs/guides/latest/volumesnapshot/overview.md).

## Prepare for VolumeSnapshot

If you don't already have a StorageClass that uses the CSI driver that supports VolumeSnapshot feature, create one first. Here, we are going to create `StorageClass` that uses [GCE Persistent Disk CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gcp-compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver).

Sample `StorageClass` YAML are given below,

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: standard
parameters:
  type: pd-standard
provisioner: pd.csi.storage.gke.io
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

The [volumeBindingMode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#volume-binding-mode) field controls when volume binding and dynamic provisioning should occur. Kubernetes allows `Immediate` and `WaitForFirstConsumer` modes for binding volumes. The `Immediate` mode indicates that volume binding and dynamic provisioning occurs once the PVC is created and `WaitForFirstConsumer` mode indicates that volume binding and provisioning does not occur until a pod is created that uses this PVC.

Let's create the `StorageClass` we have shown above,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumesnapshot/storageclass.yaml
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/standard created
```

We also need a `VolumeSnapshotClass`. We are going to use the following `VolumeSnapshotClass` for this tutorial,

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
  name: default-snapshot-class
snapshotter: pd.csi.storage.gke.io
```

Here,

- `metadata.annotations` annotations are used to set default [volumeSnapshotClass](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/10/09/introducing-volume-snapshot-alpha-for-kubernetes/).
- `snapshotter` field to point to the respective CSI driver that is responsible for taking snapshot. As we are using [GCE Persistent Disk CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gcp-compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver), we are going to use `pd.csi.storage.gke.io` in this field.

Let's create the `volumeSnapshotClass` crd we have shown above,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumesnapshot/default-volumesnapshotclass.yaml
volumesnapshotclass.snapshot.storage.k8s.io/default-snapshot-class created
```

To keep everything isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```console
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

> Note: YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumesnapshot](/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumesnapshot) directory of [stashed/docs](https://github.com/stashed/docs) repository.

## Take Volume Snapshot

Here, we are going to deploy a Deployment with two PVCs and generate some sample data on it. Then, we are going to take snapshot of those PVCs using Stash.

**Create PersistentVolumeClaim :**

At first, let's create two sample PVCs. We are going to mount these PVCs in our targeted Deployment.

Below is the YAML of the sample PVCs,

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: source-data
  namespace: demo
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: standard
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: source-config
  namespace: demo
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: standard
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Create the PVCs we have shown above.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumesnapshot/deployment/pvcs.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/source-data created
persistentvolumeclaim/source-config created
```

**Deploy Deployment :**

Now, we are going to deploy a Deployment that uses the above PVCs. This Deployment will automatically create `data.txt` and `config.cfg` file in `/source/data` and `/source/config` directory respectively where we have mounted the desired PVCs.

Below is the YAML of the Deployment that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: stash-demo
  name: stash-demo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: stash-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: stash-demo
      name: busybox
    spec:
      containers:
      - args: ["echo sample_data > /source/data/data.txt; echo sample_config > /source/config/config.cfg  && sleep 3000"]
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        image: busybox
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: busybox
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /source/data
          name: source-data
        - mountPath: /source/config
          name: source-config
      restartPolicy: Always
      volumes:
      - name: source-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
         claimName: source-data
      - name: source-config
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: source-config
```

Let's create the deployment we have shown above.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumesnapshot/deployment/deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/stash-demo created
```

Now, wait for the pod of the Deployment to go into the `Running` state.

```console
$ kubectl get pod -n demo
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
stash-demo-7fd48dd5b4-xqv5n   1/1     Running   0          2m10s
```

Verify that the sample data has been created in `/source/data` and `/source/config` directory using the following command,

```console
$ kubectl exec -n demo stash-demo-7fd48dd5b4-xqv5n -- cat /source/data/data.txt
sample_data
$ kubectl exec -n demo stash-demo-7fd48dd5b4-xqv5n -- cat /source/config/config.cfg
config_data
```

**Create BackupConfiguration :**

Now, create a `BackupConfiguration` crd to take snapshot of the PVCs of `stash-demo` Deployment.

Below is the YAML of the `BackupConfiguration` crd that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: deployments-volume-snapshot
  namespace: demo
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  driver: VolumeSnapshotter
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: stash-demo
    snapshotClassName: default-snapshot-class
  retentionPolicy:
    name: 'keep-last-5'
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

Here,

- `spec.schedule` is a [cron expression](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/#schedule) that indicates `BackupSession` will be created at 5 minute interval.

- `spec.driver` indicates the name of the agent to use to back up the target. Currently, Stash supports `Restic`, `VolumeSnapshotter` drivers. The `VolumeSnapshotter` is used to backup/restore PVC using `VolumeSnapshot` API.

- `spec.target.ref` refers to the backup target. `apiVersion`, `kind` and `name` refers to the `apiVersion`, `kind` and `name` of the targeted workload respectively. Stash will use this information to create a Volume Snapshotter Job for creating VolumeSnapshot.

- `spec.target.snapshotClassName` indicates the [VolumeSnapshotClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshot-classes/) to be used for volume snapshotting.

Let's create the `BackupConfiguration` crd we have shown above.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumesnapshot/deployment/backupconfiguration.yaml
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/deployments-volume-snapshot created
```

**Verify CronJob :**

If everything goes well, Stash will create a `CronJob` to take periodic snapshot of `source-data` and `source-config` volumes of the deployment with the schedule specified in `spec.schedule` field of `BackupConfiguration` crd.

Check that the `CronJob` has been created using the following command,

```console
$ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                          SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
deployments-volume-snapshot   */1 * * * *   False     0        39s             2m41s
```

**Wait for BackupSession :**

The `deployments-volume-snapshot` CronJob will trigger a backup on each schedule by creating a `BackpSession` crd.

Wait for the next schedule for backup. Run the following command to watch `BackupSession` crd,

```console
$ watch -n 1 kubectl get backupsession -n demo
Every 1.0s: kubectl get backupsession -n demo                      suaas-appscode: Tue Jun 18 18:35:41 2019

NAME                                     INVOKER-TYPE          INVOKER-NAME                  PHASE       AGE
deployments-volume-snapshot-1563171247   BackupConfiguration   deployments-volume-snapshot   Succeeded   50s
```

We can see above that the backup session has succeeded. Now, we are going to verify that the `VolumeSnapshot` has been created and the snapshots has been stored in the respective backend.

**Verify Volume Snapshot :**

Once a `BackupSession` crd is created, it creates volume snapshotter `Job`. Then the `Job` creates `VolumeSnapshot` crd for the targeted PVCs.The `VolumeSnapshot` name follows the following pattern:

```console
 <PVC name>-<backup session creation timestamp in Unix epoch seconds>
```

Check that the `VolumeSnapshot` has been created Successfully.

```console
$ kubectl get volumesnapshot -n demo
NAME                       AGE
source-config-1563171247   1m46s
source-data-1563171247     1m46s
```

Let's find out the actual snapshot name that will be saved in the Google Cloud by the following command,

```console
kubectl get volumesnapshot source-data-1563171247 -n demo -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2019-07-15T06:14:09Z"
  finalizers:
    - snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/volumesnapshot-protection
  generation: 4
  name: source-data-1563171247
  namespace: demo
  resourceVersion: "9220"
  selfLink: /apis/snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/demo/volumesnapshots/source-data-1563171247
  uid: c1bc3390-a6c7-11e9-9f3a-42010a800050
spec:
  snapshotClassName: default-snapshot-class
  snapshotContentName: snapcontent-c1bc3390-a6c7-11e9-9f3a-42010a800050
  source:
    apiGroup: null
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    name: source-data
status:
  creationTime: "2019-07-15T06:14:10Z"
  readyToUse: true
  restoreSize: 1Gi
```

Here, `spec.snapshotContentName` field specifies the name of the `VolumeSnapshotContent` crd. It also represents the actual snapshot name that has been saved in Google Cloud. If we navigate to the `Snapshots` tab in the GCP console, we are going to see the snapshot `snapcontent-c1bc3390-a6c7-11e9-9f3a-42010a800050` has been stored successfully.

## Restore PVC from VolumeSnapshot

This section will show you how to restore the PVCs from the snapshots we have taken in the previous section.

**Stop Taking Backup of the Old Deployment:**

At first, let's stop taking any further backup of the old Deployment so that no backup is taken during the restore process. We are going to pause the `BackupConfiguration` that we created to backup the `stash-demo` Deployment. Then, Stash will stop taking any further backup for this Deployment. You can learn more how to pause a scheduled backup [here](/docs/guides/latest/advanced-use-case/pause-backup.md)

Let's pause the `deployments-volume-snapshot` BackupConfiguration,

```console
$ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n demo deployments-volume-snapshot --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": true}}'
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/deployments-volume-snapshot patched
```

Now, wait for a moment. Stash will pause the BackupConfiguration. Verify that the BackupConfiguration  has been paused,

```console
$ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo
NAME                          TASK   SCHEDULE      PAUSED   AGE
deployments-volume-snapshot          */1 * * * *   true     18m
```

Notice the `PAUSED` column. Value `true` for this field means that the BackupConfiguration has been paused.

**Create RestoreSession :**

At first, we have to create a `RestoreSession` crd to restore the PVCs from the respective snapshot.

Below is the YAML of the `RestoreSesion` crd that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: RestoreSession
metadata:
  name: restore-pvc
  namespace: demo
spec:
  driver: VolumeSnapshotter
  target:
    volumeClaimTemplates:
      - metadata:
          name: restore-data
        spec:
          accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
          storageClassName: "standard"
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 1Gi
          dataSource:
            kind: VolumeSnapshot
            name: source-data-1563171247
            apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
      - metadata:
          name: restore-config
        spec:
          accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
          storageClassName: "standard"
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 1Gi
          dataSource:
            kind: VolumeSnapshot
            name: source-config-1563171247
            apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
```

Here,

- `spec.target.volumeClaimTemplates`:
  - `metadata.name` is a template for the name of the restored PVC that will be created by Stash. You have to provide this named template to match with the desired PVC of your Deployment.
  - `spec.dataSource`: `spec.dataSource` specifies the source of the data from where the newly created PVC will be initialized. It requires the following fields to be set:
    - `apiGroup` is the group for resource being referenced. Now, Kubernetes supports only `snapshot.storage.k8s.io`.
    - `kind` is resource of the kind being referenced. Now, Kubernetes supports only `VolumeSnapshot`.
    - `name` is the `VolumeSnapshot` resource name. In `RestoreSession` crd, You must set the VolumeSnapshot name directly.

Let's create the `RestoreSession` crd we have shown above.

```console
$ kubectl create -f ./docs/examples/guides/latest/volumesnapshot/deployment/restoresession.yaml
restoresession.stash.appscode.com/restore-pvc created
```

Once, you have created the `RestoreSession` crd, Stash will create a job to restore. We can watch the `RestoreSession` phase to check if the restore process has succeeded or not.

Run the following command to watch RestoreSession phase,

```console
$ watch -n 1 kubectl get restore -n demo
Every 1.0s: kubectl get restore -n demo                      suaas-appscode: Tue Jun 18 18:35:41 2019

NAME          REPOSITORY-NAME   PHASE       AGE
restore-pvc                     Running     10s
restore-pvc                     Succeeded   1m
```

So, we can see from the output of the above command that the restore process succeeded.

**Verify Restored PVC :**

Once the restore process is complete, we are going to see that new PVCs with the name `source-data` and `source-config` have been created.

Verify that the PVCs have been created by the following command,

```console
$ kubectl get pvc -n demo
NAME             STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
restore-config   Bound    pvc-26758eda-a6ca-11e9-9f3a-42010a800050   1Gi        RWO            standard       30s
restore-data     Bound    pvc-267335ff-a6ca-11e9-9f3a-42010a800050   1Gi        RWO            standard       30s
```

Notice the `STATUS` field. It indicates that the respective PV has been provisioned and initialized from the respective VolumeSnapshot by CSI driver and the PVC has been bound with the PV.

> The [volumeBindingMode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#volume-binding-mode) field controls when volume binding and dynamic provisioning should occur. Kubernetes allows `Immediate` and `WaitForFirstConsumer` modes for binding volumes. The `Immediate` mode indicates that volume binding and dynamic provisioning occurs once the PVC is created and `WaitForFirstConsumer` mode indicates that volume binding and provisioning does not occur until a pod is created that uses this PVC. By default `volumeBindingMode` is `Immediate`.

> If you use `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`, respective PVC will be initialized from respective VolumeSnapshot after you create a workload with that PVC. In this case, Stash will mark the restore session as completed with phase `Unknown`.

**Verify Restored Data :**

We are going to create a new Deployment with the restored PVCs to verify whether the backed up data has been restored.

Below is the YAML of the Deployment that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: restore-demo
  name: restore-demo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: restore-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: restore-demo
      name: busybox
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - sleep
        - "3600"
        image: busybox
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: busybox
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /restore/data
          name: restore-data
        - mountPath: /restore/config
          name: restore-config
      restartPolicy: Always
      volumes:
      - name: restore-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: restore-data
      - name: restore-config
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: restore-config
```

Let's create the deployment we have shown above.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/stashed/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/guides/latest/volumesnapshot/deployment/restored-deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/restore-demo created
```

Now, wait for the pod of the Deployment to go into the `Running` state.

```console
$ kubectl get pod -n demo
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
restore-demo-544db78b8b-tnzb2   1/1     Running   0          34s
```

Verify that the backed up data has been restored in `/restore/data` and `/restore/config` directory using the following command,

```console
$ kubectl exec -n demo restore-demo-544db78b8b-tnzb2 ls /restore/config/config.cfg
config_data
$ kubectl exec -n demo restore-demo-544db78b8b-tnzb2 ls /restore/data/data.txt
sample_data
```

## Cleaning Up

To clean up the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```console
kubectl delete -n demo deployment stash-demo
kubectl delete -n demo deployment restore-demo
kubectl delete -n demo backupconfiguration deployments-volume-snapshot
kubectl delete -n demo restoresession restore-pvc
kubectl delete -n demo storageclass standard
kubectl delete -n demo volumesnapshotclass default-snapshot-class
```
