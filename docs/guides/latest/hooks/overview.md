# Stash Backup and Restore Hooks

Stash `v0.9.0+` supports executing custom commands before and after backup or restore process. This is called `hook` in Stash. This guide will give you an overview of what kind of hooks you can execute, how the hooks get executed, and how the hooks behave in different scenarios.

## Types of Hooks

We can categorize Stash backup and restore hooks based on the action they perform and based on their execution order.

### Based on Action

Based on the action of a hook, we can categorize them into four different categories. These are the followings:

- **HTTPGet:** Executes an HTTP GET request before/after the backup/restore process. The hook is considered successful if the return code is between `200` and `400`.

- **HTTPPost:** Executes an HTTP POST request before/after the backup/restore process. Like `HTTPGet`, the hook is considered successful if the return code is between `200` and `400`.

- **TCPSocket:** Performs a TCP check against the provided URL on a specific port before/after the backup/restore process. The hook is considered successful if the targeted port is open.

- **Exec:** Executes commands inside a targeted container before/after the backup/restore process. The hook is considered successful if the command executes with exit code 0.

### Execution Phases

Based on the execution order, we can categorize the hooks into two different phases. These are the followings:

- **Pre-Task Hook:** Pre task hooks are executed before the backup or restore process. `preBackup` and `preRestore` are the pre-task hooks.

- **Post-Task Hook:** Post task hooks are executed after the backup or restore process. `postBackup` and `postRestore` are the post-task hooks.

However, there is one more type of hooks for [BackupBatch](/docs/concepts/crds/backupbatch.md) object. We call them **Global Hooks**. They get executed before any other individual target's hooks get executed (for the pre-task hooks) or after all the individual target's hooks has executed (for the post-task hooks).

## Who Executes the Hooks

You might be familiar that Stash uses two different models to take backup of the target based on their type. For Kubernetes workloads (i.e. Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet etc.), Stash injects a sidecar into the workload that takes backup. However, for databases and standalone PVC backup, Stash creates a job for the task. The hooks are executed differently for these two different models.

Furthermore, we have introduced [BackupBatch](/docs/concepts/crds/backupbatch.md) which allows to specify multiple target simultaneously. The individual targets may follow the sidecar model or the job model. The `BackupBatch` object allows specifying a global hook for all the targets as well as some local hooks for individual targets. This type of hooks also handled differently.

Here, we are going to discuss how Stash executes the hooks in different scenarios.

- **Sidecar Model:** In sidecar model, hooks are executed by the backup sidecar or restore init-container. The hook execution flow by sidecar/init-container is shown in the following diagram:

  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Hook Execution flow in sidecar model</figcaption>
  </figure>

- **Job Model:** In Job model, `httpGet`, `httpPost` and `tcpSocket` are executed by the backup/restore job. However, the `exec` hook is executed in the targeted application pod. In order to determine the targeted application pod, Stash uses the `Service` specified in the respective `AppBinding` crd. It first determines the endpoints of the Service. Then, it executes  the hook into one of the pod pointed by those endpoints. Hence, if the `AppBinding` points to an external URL, it is not possible for Stash to execute the `exec` hook. The hook execution flow in job model is shown in the following diagram:

    <img alt="Hook Execution flow in job model" src="/docs/images/guides/latest/hooks/job-model.svg">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Hook Execution flow in job model</figcaption>
  </figure>

- **Batch Backup:** In batch backup using `BackupBatch` object, the global hooks are executed by the Stash operator itself. When Stash operator completes executing the global pre-task hook, the individual targets start executing their local pre-task hook. Then, they complete their backup process and executes their local post-task hook. Finally, the Stash operator executes global post-task hooks. The hook execution flow in batch backup is shown in the following diagram:

## Hook's Behaviors

Now, we are going to discuss what will happen when a hook fails or backup/restore process fails.

- **Pre-Task Hook Failed:** If a pre-task hook fails to execute, the rest of the backup/restore process will be skipped and the respective `BackupSession`/`RestoreSession` will be marked as `Failed`. You may see the following things happen in addition to skipping the backup process:
  - **Backup Sidecar:** If the pre-task hook fails in the backup sidecar, the sidecar will just log the failure and continue watching for `BackupSession` for the next backup.
  - **Restore Init-Container:** If the pre-task hook fails in restore init-container, the container will crash. Hence, your workload will be stuck in the initialization phase.
  - **Backup or Restore Job:** If the pre-task hook fails in backup or restore job, the container will fail. Hence, the job will never go to the completed stage. You may see the job creating multiple pods to retry.

- **Backup/Restore Process Failed:** The post-task hook will be executed even if the backup/restore process failed. This is to cover the scenario where you have paused your application in a pre-task hook and want to resume it in a post-task hook.

- **Post-Task Hook Failed:** If the post-task hook fails to execute, the `BackupSession`/`RestoreSession` will be marked as `Failed` even if the actual backup/restore process has completed successfully. So, you may see backup data in the backend or restored data in the target even if the `BackupSession`/`RestoreSession` has marked as failed.

If the hook's behavior does not comply with your use-cases or you want more fine-grained control over the hook's behavior, please feel free to file an issue [here](https://github.com/stashed/stash/issues).
