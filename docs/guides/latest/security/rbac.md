# Stash with RBAC Enabled Cluster

Stash comes with built-in support for RBAC enabled cluster. Stash installer create a `ClusterRole` and `RoleBinding` giving necessary permission to the operator.

## Operator Permissions

Stash operator needs the following RBAC permissions,

| API Groups                   | Resources                                                      | Permissions                                 |

Here,

- `""` in API Group column means `core` API groups.
- `*` in Resources colum means all resources.
- `*` in Permission colum means all permissions.

## User facing ClusterRoles

Stash introduces resources, such as, `BackupConfiguration`,`BackupBatch`, `BackupSession`,  `Repository`, `RestoreSession`, `RestoreBatch`, `Function`, and `Task` etc. Stash installer will create 2 user facing cluster roles:

| ClusterRole         | Aggregates To | Desription                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| appscode:stash:edit | admin, edit   | Allows edit access to Stash CRDs, intended to be granted within a namespace using a RoleBinding.      |
| appscode:stash:view | view          | Allows read-only access to Stash CRDs, intended to be granted within a namespace using a RoleBinding. |

These user facing roles supports [ClusterRole Aggregation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles) feature in Kubernetes 1.9 or later clusters.
