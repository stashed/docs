# Stash NATS Addon

Stash `{{< param "info.version" >}}` supports extending its functionality through addons. Stash NATS addon enables Stash to backup and restore NATS streams.

This guide will give you an overview of which NATS versions are supported and how the docs are organized.

## Supported NATS Versions

Stash has the following addon versions for NATS:

{{< versionlist "nats">}}

Here, the addon follows `M.M.P` versioning scheme where `M.M.P` (Major.Minor.Patch) represents the respective NATS version.

## Addon Version Compatibility

This addon with matching major version with the NATS version should be able to take backup of that NATS streams. For example, NATS addon with version `2.x.x` should be able take backup of any NATS of `2.x.x` series. However, this might not be true for some versions. In that case, we will have separate addon for that version.
