# Install Stash Enterprise Edition

Stash Enterprise edition is the open core version of [Stash](https://github.com/stashed/stash). It comes with all the functionalities of Stash Community edition as well as some advanced features such as [Auto-Backup](/docs/guides/latest/auto-backup/overview.md), [Batch Backup](/docs/guides/latest/batch-backup/overview.md), and [Local Backend](/docs/guides/latest/backends/local.md) support, etc. A full features comparison between Stash Enterprise Edition and community version can be found [here](/docs/concepts/what-is-stash/overview.md).

If you are willing to try Stash Enterprise Edition, you can grab a **30 days trial** license from [here](https://license-issuer.appscode.com/).

## Get a Trial License

In this section, we are going to show you how you can get a **30 days trial** license for Stash Enterprise edition. You can get a license for your Kubernetes cluster by going through the following steps:

- At first, go to [AppsCode License Server](https://license-issuer.appscode.com/) and fill up the form. It will ask for your Name, Email, the product you want to install, and your cluster ID (UID of the `kube-system` namespace).
- Provide your name and email address. **You must provide your work email address**.
- Then, select `Stash Enterprise Edition` in the product field.
- Now, provide your cluster ID. You can get your cluster ID easily by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get ns kube-system -o=jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}'
```

- Then, you have to agree with the terms and conditions. We recommend reading it before checking the box.
- Now, you can submit the form. After you submit the form, the AppsCode License server will send an email to the provided email address with a link to your license file.
- Navigate to the provided link and save the license into a file. Here, we save the license to a `license.txt` file.

Here is a screenshot of the license form.

</figure>

You can create licenses for as many clusters as you want. You can upgrade your license any time without re-installing Stash by following the upgrading guide from [here](/docs/setup/upgrade.md#upgrading-license).

>Stash licensing process has been designed to work with CI/CD workflow. You can automatically obtain a license from your CI/CD pipeline by following the guide from [here](https://github.com/appscode/offline-license-server#offline-license-server).

To install the chart with the release name `stash-enterprise`:

$ helm repo add appscode https://charts.appscode.com/stable/
$ helm repo update
$ helm search repo appscode/stash-enterprise --version {{< param "info.enterprise" >}}
NAME                       CHART VERSION         APP VERSION         DESCRIPTION
appscode/stash-enterprise  {{< param "info.enterprise" >}}    {{< param "info.enterprise" >}}  Stash by AppsCode - Backup your Kubernetes Volumes

$ helm template stash-enterprise appscode/stash-enterprise \
  --version {{< param "info.enterprise" >}}                  \
  --namespace kube-system                       \

## Verify installation

To check if Stash operator pods have started, run the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/name=stash-enterprise --watch

NAMESPACE     NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   stash-enterprise-568c884795-hzbgg   2/2     Running   0          5h35m
```

Once the operator pod is running, you can cancel the above command by typing `Ctrl+C`.

Now, to confirm CRD groups have been registered by the operator, run the following command:
```bash
$ kubectl get crd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=stash
