# Upgrading Stash

If you are upgrading Stash to a patch release, please reapply the [installation instructions](/docs/setup/install.md). That will upgrade the operator pod to the new version and fix any RBAC issues.

## Upgrading from 0.6.x to 0.7.x

If you are installing via scripts, then uninstall the old version first and then reinstall the new version. If you are using Helm, follow the instructions from [setup](/docs/setup/install.md) section.

## Upgrading from 0.5.x to 0.6.x

The format for `Restic` object has changed in backward incompatiable manner between 0.5.x and 0.6.0 . The steps involved in upgrading Stash operator to 0.6.0 from prior version involves the following steps:

1. Backup all your old `Restic` CRDs.
2. Delete your old `Restic` objects. It will stop taking backups and remove sidecars from pods.
3. Uninstall old `Stash` operator.
4. Move repositories to new location if you want to keep your old backups. We have changed repository location in new version of `Stash` to remove conflicts between  repositories for different target workloads.

**Old Version**

```
Location depending on restic.spec.useAutoPrefix:

Not Specified or, Smart:

    Deployment:             {BackendPrefix}/
    Replica Set:            {BackendPrefix}/
    Replication Controller: {BackendPrefix}/
    Stateful Set:           {BackendPrefix}/{PodName}/
    Daemon Set:             {BackendPrefix}/{NodeName}/

NodeName: {BackendPrefix}/{NodeName}/
PodName:  {BackendPrefix}/{PodName}/
None:     {BackendPrefix}/
```

**New Version**

```
Deployment:             {BackendPrefix}/deployment/{WorkloadName}/
Replica Set:            {BackendPrefix}/replicaset/{WorkloadName}/
Replication Controller: {BackendPrefix}/replicationcontroller/{WorkloadName}/
Stateful Set:           {BackendPrefix}/statefulset/{PodName}/
Daemon Set:             {BackendPrefix}/daemonset/{WorkloadName}/{NodeName}/
```

5. Install new `Stash` operator.
6. Update your backed up `Restic` CRDs in the following ways:
- `restic.spec.useAutoPrefix` is removed in new version of `Stash`. If you specify it in your old `Restic` CRD, you should remove it.
- `restic.spec.fileGroups[].retentionPolicy` is moved to `restic.spec.retentionPolicies[]` and referenced using `restic.spec.fileGroups[].retentionPolicyName`.

Consider following example:

**Old version:**

```yaml
fileGroups:
- path: /source/path-1
  retentionPolicy:
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
- path: /source/path-2
  retentionPolicy:
    keepLast: 10
- path: /source/path-3
  retentionPolicy:
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

**New version:**

```yaml
fileGroups:
- path: /source/path-1
  retentionPolicyName: policy-1
- path: /source/path-2
  retentionPolicyName: policy-2
- path: /source/path-3
  retentionPolicyName: policy-1
retentionPolicies:
- name: policy-1
  keepLast: 5
  prune: true
- name: policy-2
  keepLast: 10
```

7. Now, re-deploy restic CRDs. It will add sidecar to pods again and continue backup.


### Example: Upgrading S3 backed volume

Say, you are running `Stash` operator `0.5.1`.

```console
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app=stash
NAMESPACE     NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   stash-operator-7cdc467c5b-drj2r   2/2       Running   0          2s

$ kubectl exec -it stash-operator-7cdc467c5b-drj2r -c operator -n kube-system stash version

Version = 0.5.1
VersionStrategy = tag
Os = alpine
Arch = amd64
CommitHash = f87995af4875d5e99978def17186ac1957871c1d
GitBranch = release-0.5
GitTag = 0.5.1
CommitTimestamp = 2017-10-10T17:05:31
```

Consider you have following `busybox` deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: stash-demo
  name: stash-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: stash-demo
      name: busybox
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - sleep
        - "3600"
        image: busybox
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: busybox
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /source/data
          name: source-data
      restartPolicy: Always
      volumes:
      - gitRepo:
          repository: https://github.com/stashed/stash-data.git
        name: source-data
```

Let say you are using following old `Restic` CRD to backup the `busybox` deployment:

```yaml
$ kubectl get restic s3-restic -o yaml

apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restic
metadata:
  clusterName: ""
  creationTimestamp: 2017-12-11T08:29:16Z
  deletionGracePeriodSeconds: null
  deletionTimestamp: null
  generation: 0
  initializers: null
  name: s3-restic
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "39256"
  selfLink: /apis/stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/restics/s3-restic
  uid: 5ffb03c7-de4d-11e7-af32-0800274b5eab
spec:
  backend:
    s3:
      bucket: stash-qa
      endpoint: s3.amazonaws.com
      prefix: demo
    storageSecretName: s3-secret
  fileGroups:
  - path: /source/data
    retentionPolicy:
      keepLast: 5
      prune: true
  schedule: '@every 1m'
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: stash-demo
  volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /source/data
    name: source-data
status:
  backupCount: 3
  firstBackupTime: 2017-12-11T08:30:40Z
  lastBackupDuration: 19.968827042s
  lastBackupTime: 2017-12-11T08:32:40Z
```

A restic-repository is initialized in `demo` folder of your `stash-qa` bucket and so far 3 backups are created and stored there. Now, the following steps will upgrade version of `Stash` without loosing those 3 backups.

#### Step 1

Dump your old `Restic` CRD in a file.

```
$ kubectl get restic s3-restic -o yaml --export > s3-restic-dump.yaml
```

#### Step 2

Delete the old `Restic` object.

```
$ kubectl delete restic s3-restic
restic "s3-restic" deleted
```

Now wait for sidecar to be removed by `Stash` operator.

```
$ kubectl get pods -l app=stash-demo
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
stash-demo-6b5459b8d6-7rvpv   2/2       Terminating   0       5s
stash-demo-788ffcf9c6-xh6nx   1/1       Running       0       1s
```

#### Step 3

Uninstall old `Stash` operator by following the instructions [here](/docs/setup/uninstall.md).

#### Step 4

To keep your old backups you should move the contents of your old repositories to new locations.

```
Old location: stash-qa/demo
New location: stash-qa/demo/deployment/stash-demo
```

You can use [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli) to do this:

```
$ aws s3 mv s3://stash-qa/demo s3://stash-qa/demo/deployment/stash-demo --recursive
```

#### Step 5

Install new `Stash` operator by following the instructions [here](/docs/setup/install.md).

#### Step 6

Now update your backed up `Restic` CRD as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restic
metadata:
  clusterName: ""
  creationTimestamp: 2017-12-11T08:29:16Z
  deletionGracePeriodSeconds: null
  deletionTimestamp: null
  generation: 0
  initializers: null
  name: s3-restic
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "39256"
  selfLink: /apis/stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/restics/s3-restic
  uid: 5ffb03c7-de4d-11e7-af32-0800274b5eab
spec:
  backend:
    s3:
      bucket: stash-qa
      endpoint: s3.amazonaws.com
      prefix: demo
    storageSecretName: s3-secret
  fileGroups:
  - path: /source/data
    retentionPolicyName: policy-1
  schedule: '@every 1m'
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: stash-demo
  volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /source/data
    name: source-data
  retentionPolicies:
  - name: policy-1
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
status:
  backupCount: 3
  firstBackupTime: 2017-12-11T08:30:40Z
  lastBackupDuration: 19.968827042s
  lastBackupTime: 2017-12-11T08:32:40Z
```

Re-deploy the updated `Restic` CRD.

```
$ kubectl apply -f s3-restic.yaml
```

It will add sidecar to the `busybox` pods again and continue backup from where it stopped. You can check status of the `Restic` CRD to verify that new backups are creating.

```yaml
$ kubectl get restic s3-restic -o yaml

apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restic
metadata:
  clusterName: ""
  creationTimestamp: 2017-12-11T09:36:08Z
  deletionGracePeriodSeconds: null
  deletionTimestamp: null
  generation: 0
  initializers: null
  name: s3-restic
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "44000"
  selfLink: /apis/stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/restics/s3-restic
  uid: b7511b7a-de56-11e7-af32-0800274b5eab
spec:
  backend:
    s3:
      bucket: stash-qa
      endpoint: s3.amazonaws.com
      prefix: demo
    storageSecretName: s3-secret
  fileGroups:
  - path: /source/data
    retentionPolicyName: policy-1
  retentionPolicies:
  - keepLast: 5
    name: policy-1
    prune: true
  schedule: '@every 1m'
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: stash-demo
  volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /source/data
    name: source-data
status:
  backupCount: 4
  firstBackupTime: 2017-12-11T08:30:40Z
  lastBackupDuration: 18.786502029s
  lastBackupTime: 2017-12-11T09:37:38Z
```


### Example: Upgrading GCS backed volume

Consider you have following gcs backend instead of s3 backend:

```yaml
backend:
  gcs:
    bucket: stash-qa
    prefix: demo
  storageSecretName: gcs-secret
```

You can follow the same steps as the above s3 example. To move old repository to new location using [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/mv#renaming-bucket-subdirectories), run:

```console
$ gsutil mv gs://stash-qa/demo gs://stash-qa/demo/deployment/stash-demo
```
