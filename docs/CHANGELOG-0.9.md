# Change Log

## [v0.9.0-rc.2](https://github.com/stashed/stash/tree/v0.9.0-rc.2)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/stashed/stash/compare/v0.9.0-rc.1...v0.9.0-rc.2)

Stash `v0.9.0-rc.2` comes with some bug fixes and improvements since `v0.9.0-rc.1` release. Please, try it and give us your valuable feedback. To install, please follow the guide [here](https://appscode.com/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.2/setup/install/).

## Significant Changes

- **Retention Policy for VolumeSnapshot:** We have implemented retention policy for VolumeSnapshot. Now, your old VolumeSnapshots will be automatically garbage collected according to retention policy. Ref: [stashed/stash#926](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/926).

- **Fix Argument Passing:** We have fixed argument passing to database backup/restore commands. Ref: [stashed/mongodb#5](https://github.com/stashed/mongodb/pull/5), [stashed/postgres#17](https://github.com/stashed/postgres/pull/17), [stashed/elasticsearch#8](https://github.com/stashed/elasticsearch/pull/8), [stashed/mysql#9](https://github.com/stashed/mysql/pull/9).

- **BackupSession API Revision:** Now a `BackupSession` can be triggered via `spec.invoker` instead of `spec.backupConfiguration` field. This breaking api change is done in preparation for upcoming `BackupBatch` crd support. Ref: [stashed/stash#890](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/890), [stashed/stash#931](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/931), [stashed/docs#44](https://github.com/stashed/docs/pull/44).

## [v0.9.0-rc.1](https://github.com/stashed/stash/tree/v0.9.0-rc.1)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/stashed/stash/compare/v0.9.0-rc.0...v0.9.0-rc.1)

Stash `v0.9.0-rc.1` comes with documentation and respective charts for addons to backup databases. It also comes with some bug fixes since `v0.9.0-rc.0` release. We have also introduced a `kubectl` plugin for Stash in this release. Please, try it and give us your valuable feedback.  To install, please follow the guide [here](https://appscode.com/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.1/setup/install/).

## Significant Changes

- **Addon Support:** Stash addons enable users to extend it's functionality to backup/restore any type of custom workloads. This release includes respective documentations and charts for `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `MongoDB`, and `Elasticsearch` databases. This enables Stash to backup various [KubeDB](https://kubedb.com/) supported databases. You can also write your own addon to backup your custom target. We will include a guide on how to build addon for Stash in a future release.

- **Stash `kubectl` Plugin (Alpha):** We have introduced an experimental Stash `kubectl` plugin. This will help you to unlock repository, trigger instant backup and copy various Stash resources between namespace and more.

- **Introduce BackupHistoryLimit:** Now, you can configure how many `BackupSession` and associate resources (Job, PVC etc) to keep for each backup target. By default, Stash will keep only the history of last backup for debugging purpose. You can configure it using `spec.backupHistoryLimit` field of `BackupConfiguration`.

- **Introduce InterimVolumeTemplate:** We have introduced a new field called `InterimVolumeTemplate` that can be used to pass a PVC template for storing temporary backup/restore data before uploading to backup or injecting into target. For more details, please visit [here](https://appscode.com/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.1/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration/).

- **Allow `subPath` in Auto-Backup Annotation:** Now, you can provide `subPath` in auto-backup annotation. For more details, please check [here](https://appscode.com/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.1/guides/latest/auto-backup/workload/).

- **Use Kubebuilder to Generate CRDs:** We have moved to [kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) for generating CRDs for Stash.

## [v0.9.0-rc.0](https://github.com/stashed/stash/tree/v0.9.0-rc.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/stashed/stash/compare/0.8.3...v0.9.0-rc.0)

We are very excited to announce Stash `v0.9.0-rc.0`. This release introduces `v1beta1` API and a design overhaul. The new API and design enable Stash to support the use cases that were not possible before. This makes Stash more powerful, transparent, extensible and customizable. We are expecting that this new API will graduate to GA after some maturity. Check out the new architecture from [here](https://github.com/stashed/docs/blob/v0.9.0-rc.0/docs/concepts/what-is-stash/architecture.md).

### Significant Changes

- Stash now has been moved from [appscode](https://github.com/appscode) Github organization to its own organization. New home for Stash is [stashed](https://github.com/stashed) organization.
- We have split the original `appscode/stash` repository into multiple repositories ([stashed/stash](https://github.com/stashed/stash), [stashed/installer](https://github.com/stashed/installer), [stashed/docs](https://github.com/stashed/docs)). This enables us to push emergency fixes to installer and docs without requiring to cut a new release.
- Now Stash uses a more industry-standard `Makefile` based build process. This makes building Stash from source code simple and easy ([\#800](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/800)).
- We have added ARM architecture support in this release. Thanks to  @carlosedp ([\#802](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/802)).
- We now use [Docker manifest](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest/) to build Stash docker images. Hence, Stash docker images are now platform aware. You don't have to worry about your platform architecture. Docker will take care of it ([\#802](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/802)).
- We have updated [restic](https://restic.net/) version from `0.8.3` to `0.9.5` ([\#789](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/789)).
- We have upgraded Kubernetes client to `v1.14.0` ([\#775](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/775)).
- Now Stash uses `failurePolicy: Ignore` in webhooks for Kubernetes official resources. So, Stash will no longer cause any problem for creating new Kubernetes resources when it is not ready ([\#726](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/726)).
- As RBAC is now default in most of the Kubenetes cluster and creating RBAC resources in an RBAC disabled cluster does not cause any problem, we have removed `--rbac` flag. Now, Stash will always start in RBAC enabled mode ([\#761](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/761)).
- We have moved to [go mod](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) from [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) for dependency management ([\#775](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/775)).
- We have changed Stash package path to `stash.appscode.dev/stash` ([\#776](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/776)).

### Upgrading from 0.8.3

If you are upgrading Stash from `0.8.3` to this version, pay attention to the following things:

**What will work:**
- Exiting scheduled backup will continue to work.
- Scheduling new backup using Restic crd will work.
- Restoring the already backed up data using Recovery crd will work.

**What will not work:**
- Restoring the data that was backed up using old API (`Restic`) with the new API (`RestoreSession`) will not work.
- Restoring the data that was backed up using new API (`BackupConfiguration`) with the old API (`Recovery`) will not work.
- Using new API (`BackupConfiguration` ) to backup into already existing Repository will not work. Stash will upload all targeted data again into the backend. Old snapshots will not be usable any more.
- Old Grafana dashboard will not work with new metrics.
