# Frequently Asked Questions

## How to temporarily pause a backup?

### Pause Backup

Run the following commands to pasue a backup temporarily,

```bash
# pause backup by patching BackupConfiguration
❯ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n <namespace> <backupconfiguration name> --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": true}}'

# pause backup using Stash `kubectl` plugin 
❯ kubectl stash pause backup -n demo --backupconfig=<backupconfiguration name>
```

### Resume Backup

Similarly you can also resume a paused backup. Run the following commands to resume a backup,

```bash
# resume backup by patching BackupConfiguration
kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n <namespace> <backupconfiguration name> --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": false}}'

# resume backup using Stash `kubectl` plugin
❯ kubectl stash resume backup -n demo --backupconfig=<backupconfiguration name>
```

## When `retentionPolicy` is applied?

`retentionPolicy` specifies the policy to follow for cleaning old snapshots. Stash removes any snapshot from backend that falls outside the scope of the policy. When a `BackupSession` is completed, Stash checks for outdated snapshots according to the `retentionPolicy` and remove them. If you use the policy `keep-last-5`, Stash will remove any snapshot that is older than the most recent 5 snapshots. 

## Do I need to delete the init containers after recovery?

You don't need to delete the init containers after recovery.  If your workload restarts with the `stash-init` init-container for any reason, the init-container will skip running restore process if there is no pending RestoreSession for this workload. If you delete the RestoreSession, Stash will remove the `init-container` automatically. Beware that it will cause your workload to restart.
